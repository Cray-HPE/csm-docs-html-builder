# Recognized tokens:
# ${BRANCH} - branch name from ${BRANCHES} array define din the config file
# ${SUFFIX} - branch name with dots stripped (e.g. 1.2 turns to 12)
# ${LAST_SUFFIX} - ${SUFFIX} generated for last branch
# ${WEIGHT} - a number evaluated as <branch_index> * 10 (for Hugo config file weights)
# ${PRODUCT_NAME} - product name (csm, sat, etc)
